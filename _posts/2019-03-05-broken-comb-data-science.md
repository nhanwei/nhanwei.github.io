Over the past 1 month, I had the opportunity to talk data science(DS) with people from many different walks of life. They ranged from developers, senior technical leaders, recent graduates, mid career switchers and aspiring data scientists. While I think it is okay for diverse opinions, it is still necessary to firm up the key details regarding some areas of this field. I will write this post with the following intents.

## 1. Intents
1. Some common misconceptions of DS.
2. Beyond the T-shape: Why you should follow the broken comb instead(for DS).
3. Run-through of DS skills and tools

## 2. Some common misconceptions of DS

*<center>It's all about the cool Machine Learning(ML) algorithms!</center>*
A common misconception of DS is that it is all about the ML algorithms. Oftentimes, many places choose to focus only on the juicy and exciting topics. Usually they focus on new ML algorithms, new real-life application of DS, how AI can replace humans or promising improved results from some research programme. What they fail to write about are the unglamorous chores such as data pre-processing, feature engineering and exploratory data analysis. This is the bulk of the work in a data science project and is mission-critical to the success of the algorithms that comes much later. As a rough gauge, this usually takes up 70% of a data scientist's time on a project. 

*<center>As long as the project involves data, we need a data scientist!</center>*
For those unfamiliar with DS, it may seems that anything and everything that involves data requires a data scientist. I feel that this stems from the confusion between DS and Business Intelligence(BI) which people are generally more familiar with. In BI, it is more for **Descriptive Analytics** or reporting. I.e. I'm trying to describe the past year financial performance. In DS, we are more concerned about **Predictive Analytics** or **Prescriptive Analytics**. I.e. I want to predict customer churn. 

While there is a difference, I do agree that there are some overlaps between BI and DS. E.g. Business analysts also do revenue forecasting. Isn't that predictive analytics? Well, what happens if you have to  incorporate text and image data collected from your company's facebook page? Can your traditional BI tools handle anything other than tabular data? 

In DS, we have become more concerned about unstructured data (e.g. text, audio, image) which has formed the main bulk of data existing in the world today. The volume and velocity of data collected and waiting for processing each day is of a completely different scale. Think quarterly sales reporting versus the number of tweets on Twitter per day.

I may have delved too much into this. However, the key point is that sometimes, what you need is not a data scientist but a data analyst or business analyst.

*<center>Data Science must have fancy visualisations!</center>*
In DS, a lot of data scientists usually do not go beyond the usual scatter plots, bar charts and line graphs. Basically most of the graphics you can find in Microsoft Excel (Although we use Python or R to generate these plots). Sometimes we may use the occasional country/world maps, heatmaps or graph networks which really depends on your domain (e.g. Telecomm, Transport).

As I have mentioned, we spend a majority of our time pre-processing the data. Usually for this stage, we will use simple graphs like bi-variate plots. We also plot graphs for model evaluations. Most data scientists do not have the time to design meticulous interactive graphics. Neither is it part of our core skillset (Just find a few job descriptions). Those fancy visualisations that you saw online? Probably done by a team of dedicated frontend developers.

## 6. Summing Up

That was a pretty detailed recollection of how I got started and most of the things I've in the past 4-5 years. I am definitely still not a very seasoned data practitioner (*I don't like the term data scientist.*) and there are just SO MANY areas to research and read up on. I still spend around 10-20 hours every week to read up and pick up new DS knowledge. 

Thanks for reading the post. Hope it was informative and helped in some way!
