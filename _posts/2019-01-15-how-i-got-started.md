# *DRAFT*

## 1. Intent
1. A retrospection on my Data Science(DS) journey for the past 5 years.
2. To motivate aspiring data practitioners. I think it is helpful to go through someone else's journey.
3. To share thought processes and personal/general reflection.

## 2. Conundrums (2014)

<center>*PLANNING IS IMPORTANT.*</center>

Back in 2014, I have just returned from a 10 weeks long internship in Bangalore at Infosys' beautiful electronic city campus tucked far away from the bustling city centre. As all interns get to stay in Infosys' campus and we only get 2 free two-way cab rides out of campus every week, I have had many long nights and a lot of time to contemplate about my career. I realised that

<center>**Career planning is hard.**</center>

It will always be daunting not matter at which stage of your life. It is full of uncertainty and self-doubts. You are never sure if you are good enough or you will even be shortlisted. There's just way too many moving parts, too many variables. So with the most mathematical way of simplifying things, I fix the variables except one and analyze it individually. Eventually I narrowed down the problem and distilled it down into a couple of angles:
* Government services or Private sector?
	* Government service: Iron rice bowl, guaranteed above average salary, red tapes, less autonomy, harder to leave.
	* Private sector: Uncertain prospects, riskier compared to government service which also directly translates to **more opportunity to hustle hard.**
* Statistics or Actuarial Science or Programming?
	* Statistics: Natural path since that is my major.
	* Actuarial Science: A time-tested path to a stable and good paying career as long as you continue to take certifications.
	* Programming: I enjoyed R programming **a lot.**
* Industry (e.g. banking finance, telco, tech)?
	* I was pretty open minded about the industries. It didn't really matter to me.
* Money or Passion?
	* Money: It's definitely important but is it important enough for me to jeopardize long term goals for short term gains?
	* Passion: I was really certain about what I enjoyed doing which was Statistics and Programming at that time (and even now).

I first read about **big data** during my 1st undergraduate internship at Singapore Police Force. It was an internship on "Big Data in Policing" where I had to do a lot of reading on the subject matter. It was at that time when I learnt of **big data analytics** which is an up-and-coming field (at that time) that is an amalgamation of **Statistics**, **Computer Science** and **Business Domain Knowledge**. That piqued my interest because it contains two of my favourite things, Statistics and Programming. 

Once I was able to plan and study the problem this way. It was a no-brainer. I knew roughly what I had to do and the next step was to decide on a path and stick to it.

## 3. ACTION (2014 - 2015)

<center>*FIRST JOB IS IMPORTANT AND IT SETS THE TONE FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF YOUR CAREER.*</center>

Back then there wasn't a major -for Data Analytics in National University of Singapore(NUS)(They came up with Business Analytics in 2015 after I graduated.) At that time I felt that whatever I have learnt in NUS still did not prepare me for a career in DS. It was never meant to since it was only a major in Statistics. So I went ahead and enrolled myself into <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">**Prof Andrew Ng's Machine Learning MOOC on Coursera**</a>. Till this day, even after taking more than 30 MOOCS since 2015, this MOOC remains the most important and impactful course for me. The fundamentals and theories of Machine Learning(ML) taught in the course continues to stay relevant to my work.

After I came back from India to continue my 4th and last year of studies, I went ahead to take up and complete all 10 courses under the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">**Data Science Specialisation taught by Johns Hopkins University**</a>. It was a beginner DS specialisation which was relatively simple. It did help boost my confidence to apply for DS jobs. At the same time, I also started to dabble into <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">kaggle</a> and try out some competitions.

During the job application process, I applied very widely across multiple industries as long as they were open to hire junior staff for DS work. Take note that you have to read the job description carefully and make sure that it is a DS and not a BI role. Good way to do this is to look at the set of technical skillsets they are looking out for and ask good questions during interview. I also applied for a couple of statistician roles for good measures. Eventually I was offered two positions before graduation and I had the time to carefully think it through. (*Good to apply for jobs early if you are still in school.*) 

One of them was a statistician role at a Ministry in Singapore while the other role was a data analyst role at a local telecommunication company. I accepted the data analyst role although it pays around 23% lesser than the statistician role. The key motivation was because of the DS learning opportunity as well as the alignment with my long term goal. It was not easy to give up the higher paying job but I was really grateful for being offered the data analyst role because I knew I was not fully qualified for the job. I believe I was offered because of the extra DS activities I was doing outside school and my boss was also willing to groom a junior staff.

## 4. StarHub (2015 - 2016)

At StarHub, I was a data analyst in their relatively new data science team. There were a couple of things that I really liked about the team/role:
* **Teammates**: Full of talented and motivated individuals/seniors who are so willing to share their knowledge and help out whenever they can. (*This is not easy to find*)
* **Collaborative Environment**: I can't speak for other teams in the department but I felt my team had this sharing and open culture. There wasn't any politics within the team and we collaborated very closely for many different projects. This is so important for a junior staff because **I got to emulate what the seniors guys were doing and that accelerated my learning by many folds.** 
* **Technology**: Within 1 year, I was exposed to a lot of technologies which was how I picked up so many new stuff in a short period. Before the team shifted their stack, I had to write codes in Pig(new), Java(new), Python(new) and R. Eventually I also have to write pyspark(new) code. (*I can still write in Pig and pyspark. Python became my lingua franca in replacement of R. These are useful DS tools. I can't write java anymore.*)
* **Mentor**: I was allocated a mentor who is very smart, experienced and willing to share his knowledge. I was able to share any concern or ask any question very freely with him and that helped a lot to boost my knowledge and confidence. (*It is important to find a mentor*)
* **Data**: StarHub, a local telecommuncation company, has tons of customer data. It was one of the biggest pull factor when I accepted the job. You need data to do data science. It's simple as that. (*One of the key questions you need to ask during an interview.*)
* **Jobscope**: I liked that it was in a startup-ish environment. I was involved in all sorts of work like adhoc data analysis, engineer logic for new features, design algorithms, attend external meetings, and even present demos on our product for potential clients. I was full responsbile for my own section and had almost full autonomy. In hindsight, it's amazing how much trust was given to me and that was mostly due to my boss.
* **Boss**: Also a veteran in the industry. I appreciate the trust he placed on the team to do our job by doing little micro-management. I also liked how he was very frank with me. He was not afraid to scold me when I made a mistake(*yea I got scolded very badly by him once for some mistake.*). He also gave constructive feedbacks which I really appreciate **a lot**. I believe that only bosses who truly cares will give constructive feedbacks. 

Strictly speaking, this role was missing the ML side of DS. So at the same time, I was still actively exploring kaggle competitions and reading their kernels. (*It's good to know what you want in your career so that you can do something about it. I knew my role in StarHub lacks the ML aspects which is why I actively kept up my ML knowledge. One of my Kaggle projects was a topic I talked about with the interviewers in DBS.*)

## 5. DBS (2016 - 2018)

After 1.5 years at StarHub, I landed an opportunity for a data scientist role at DBS Bank. I will be in charge of supporting regional consumer banking group for the bank especially for Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. 

It was at DBS Bank where I immensely honed my skills in practical ML. I was involved in the whole end to end process of every DS project and here are some main steps:
* **It always starts from Business**: Understanding business requirements needs active listening and open discussions with all parties. That is only half of the job. The other half is to for you to frame the business problem into a DS problem. *What is the event definition or target variable? What are the success factors for this model to work, for business to want to use it? What is the timeline?*
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Pulling data from respective database (e.g. Hbase, Teradata, SAS database). Exploration of datasets and its relationship with the target variable. Data Cleaning. Preliminary variable selection is also required because there are thousands of variables in the database.
* **Model Building**: Trying out different models, usually starting with the simpler models (e.g. GBM, RF, Logistics Reg) because they are much easier to explain to business. 
* **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the results of the models, picking the top few models and share the results with business.

*This is an iterative process. We meet business users very often and repeat some of these steps all the time.* 
*I have also omitted some details and steps for brevity. Also I didn't have to deploy my own models.*

It was also at DBS Bank where I got into building my first recommender system under the mentorship of one of the seniors. I built a simple model in China DBS for the relationship managers. When I came back, I was tasked to build another recommender system completely on my own as the sole contributor (*That senior left the bank shortly after I returned to SG.*) It was difficult at first because no one else in the team had any idea how to help or build one. It was after reading a lot of papers and articles that I managed to find and implement a deep learning model that outperforms the old rule based model and fulfil multiple business requirements. 

At DBS, I learnt a lot about different financial products, building marketing propensity models and recommender systems. My experiences also showed me the importance of aligning the model with business outcomes.
