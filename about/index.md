My name is Stan Neo and I am a seasoned instructor specialising in Python, SQL, Tableau and Machine Learning. I enjoy breaking down complex concepts into digestible, practical lessons.

Over the years I have trained corporate teams and individuals, built end‑to‑end machine learning solutions and consulted on data projects. I am now channeling my experience into career coaching for those looking to transition or advance within the data and tech industry.

When I’m not teaching or coaching, I tinker with new tech stacks and explore how data can empower businesses. You can usually find me reading up on the latest ML trends or experimenting with visualisations in Tableau.

Feel free to reach out if you’re keen on training, mentorship or simply a chat about growing your career in data and tech.
