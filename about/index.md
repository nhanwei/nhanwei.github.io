My name is Neo Han Wei. You can also call me Stan.

I currently lead the [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](https://metis.kaplan.com.sg/) in Singapore. I teach and coach aspiring data scientists. I also do freelance corporate and individual training for Python coding and Machine Learning. I spend the rest of my time at the intersection of ML, Product and Data Engineering, trying to integrate them as seamlessly as possible. I am also very interested in cloud technologies and got myself AWS certified earlier this year.

Previously, I built ML models in Singapore's largest bank [DBS](https://www.dbs.com.sg) for their regional retail markets for product cross-sell, up-sell, etc. I revamped how the bank recommend products to customers by developing the bank's first Deep Learning based Recommender System for Online/Mobile Advertisements. I also initiated a project, later known as Self-Assisted Modelling (SAM) in DBS, which is a tool that allows business users to build their own ML models. 

My hobbies come and go. Currently, I enjoy taking pictures, walking, cooking (and eating), [aquascaping](/assets/doc/aquascape.png) and optimizing my [RimWorld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/). I also enjoy reading academic papers and taking courses on ML, cloud and data engineering which I also consider as hobbies.

This is my [semi-updated resume](/assets/doc/stanneo_resume_2020_v5.pdf) if you are into it.
