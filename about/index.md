My name is Neo Han Wei. You can also call me Stan.

I currently lead the [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](https://metis.kaplan.com.sg/) in Singapore. I teach and coach aspiring data scientists. I also run a small business [CodeAI](https://www.code-ai.co/) to teach more people coding. I spend the rest of my time at the intersection of ML, Product and Data Engineering, trying to integrate them as seamlessly as possible.

Previously, I built ML models in Singapore's largest bank [DBS](https://www.dbs.com.sg) for their regional markets. I revamped how the bank recommend products to customers by developing the bank's first [Deep Learning based Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792). 

I am currently working on my Masters in Computer Science at National University of Singapore (ETC end of 2019).

My hobbies come and go. Currently, I enjoy taking pictures, walking, cooking (and eating), aquascaping and optimizing my [RimWorld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/). I also enjoy taking courses on ML, cloud and data engineering which I also consider as a hobby.

This is my [semi-updated resume](/assets/doc/resume_2019_v3.pdf) if you are into it.
